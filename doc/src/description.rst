System Storage Manager provides an easy to use command line interface to
manage your storage using various technologies like lvm, btrfs, encrypted
volumes and more.

In more sophisticated enterprise storage environments, management with Device
Mapper (dm), Logical Volume Manager (LVM), or Multiple Devices (md) is
becoming increasingly more difficult.  With file systems added to the mix, the
number of tools needed to configure and manage storage has grown so large that
it is simply not user friendly.  With so many options for a system
administrator to consider, the opportunity for errors and problems is large.

The btrfs administration tools have shown us that storage management can be
simplified, and we are working to bring that ease of use to Linux filesystems
in general.
