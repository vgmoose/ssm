This command removes an **item** from the system. Multiple items can be
specified.  If the **item** cannot be removed for some reason, it will be
skipped.

An **item** can be any of the following:

device
    Remove a **device** from the pool. Note that this cannot be done in some
    cases where the device is being used by the pool. You can use the **-f** argument to
    *force* removal. If the device does not belong to any pool, it will be
    skipped.

pool
    Remove a **pool** from the system. This will also remove all volumes
    created from that pool.

volume
    Remove a **volume** from the system. Note that this will fail if the
    **volume** is mounted and cannot be *forced* with **-f**.
