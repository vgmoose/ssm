This command will mount the **volume** at the specified **directory**. The
**volume** can be specified in the same way as with **mount(8)**, however in
addition, one can also specify a **volume** in the format as it appears in the
**ssm list** table.

For example, instead of finding out what the device and subvolume id of the
btrfs subvolume "btrfs_pool:vol001" is in order to mount it, one can simply
call **ssm mount btrfs_pool:vol001 /mnt/test**.

One can also specify *OPTIONS* in the same way as with **mount(8)**.
