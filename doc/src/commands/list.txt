Lists information about all detected devices, pools, volumes and snapshots found
on the system. The **list** command can be used either alone to list all of the
information, or you can request specific sections only.

The following sections can be specified:

{volumes | vol}
    List information about all **volumes** found in the system.

{devices | dev}
    List information about all **devices** found on the system. Some devices
    are intentionally hidden, like for example cdrom or DM/MD devices since those
    are actually listed as volumes.

{pools | pool}
    List information about all **pools** found in the system.

{filesystems | fs}
    List information about all volumes containing **filesystems** found in
    the system.

{snapshots | snap}
    List information about all **snapshots** found in the system. Note that
    some back-ends do not support snapshotting and some cannot distinguish
    snapshot from regular volumes. In this case, **ssm** will try to recognize the
    volume name in order to identify a **snapshot**, but if the **ssm** regular
    expression does not match the snapshot pattern, the problematic snapshot will
    not be recognized.
