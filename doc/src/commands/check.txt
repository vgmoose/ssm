Check the file system consistency on the **volume**. You can specify multiple
volumes to check. If there is no file system on the **volume**, this **volume**
will be skipped.

In some cases the file system has to be mounted in order to check the file
system.  This will be handled by **ssm** automatically by mounting the
**volume** temporarily.
