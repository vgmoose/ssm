You can get System Storage Manager from the git repository on SourceForge
project page http://sourceforge.net/p/storagemanager/code/. There are two
branches: ``master`` which contains the stable release and ``devel`` where
the development is happening. Once in a while the ``devel`` branch is
merged into ``master``, releasing new version of System Storage Manager.
Obviously the ``devel`` branch is more up-to-date, however it might not be
as stable as the ``master`` branch. System Storage Manager has its own
regression testing suite, so we're trying hard not to break things that
already work.

You can check out the ``master`` branch of the git repository::

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/storagemanager/code ssm
